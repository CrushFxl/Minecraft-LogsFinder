[09:13:22] [Paper Watchdog Thread/ERROR]: The server has stopped responding! This is (probably) not a Paper bug.
[09:13:22] [Paper Watchdog Thread/ERROR]: If you see a plugin in the Server thread dump below, then please report it to that author
[09:13:22] [Paper Watchdog Thread/ERROR]: 	 *Especially* if it looks like HTTP or MySQL operations are occurring
[09:13:22] [Paper Watchdog Thread/ERROR]: If you see a world save or edit, then it means you did far more than your server can handle at once
[09:13:22] [Paper Watchdog Thread/ERROR]: 	 If this is the case, consider increasing timeout-time in spigot.yml but note that this will replace the crash with LARGE lag spikes
[09:13:22] [Paper Watchdog Thread/ERROR]: If you are unsure or still think this is a Paper bug, please report this to https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/issues
